# About Industrial Architecture of Montreal

Industrial Architecture of Montreal is an index of approximately 130 industrial buildings in Montreal. It was originally created in 1999 by McGill’s Blackader-Lauterman Library, led by Marilyn Berger. The site was migrated to CollectionBuilder in 2024; [view the original site from 1999 via Archive-It](https://wayback.archive-it.org/22619/20240415175427/https://digital.library.mcgill.ca/industrial/). While the site’s content has not been updated since its initial launch in 1999, certain features have been changed or modernized.

For almost a century Montreal was the industrial centre of Canada. Between 1847-1945, the area surrounding the Lachine Canal had the highest concentration of industrial buildings in the country. The variety of buildings included factories, elevators, warehouses, mills, and refineries which today provide a legacy of historic and architectural interest. Beginning in the late 20th century, industrial districts of Montreal were remodeled and transformed, particularly in the vicinity of the Lachine Canal, as part of the city's deindustrialization. This project aimed collect, organize, and preserve textual and visual information on key industrial buildings before their transformations.

Entries in the database contain historical and contemporary images of the building, it’s name, address, building type and dates relating to its construction. Many entries also include information about the architect, historical images, building materials, present use, alterations and renovations.

Citations to books, periodicals and newspaper articles which include details about illustrations accompany the architectural information provided. An on-line database provides access to compiled information. This database is patterned after the Archindont project--the Architectural Index for Ontario--an initiative by the Toronto Reference Library.

The project also researched biographical information on several architects of Montreal’s industrial architecture. Prominent architects and firms from Montreal’s history such as Alexander Hutchison; John Ostell; Hopkins, Lawford & Nelson, and Ross & Macdonald are featured. It also includes information on engineering firms such as T. Pringle & Son and John Metcalfe & Co.
